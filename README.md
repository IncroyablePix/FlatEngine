# FlatEngine

## Introduction
FlatEngine is a poorly designed game engine (more like a loose framework or a library) full of tools for making 2D games programatically. I wrote this as a java-training.

## Flaws
It has a lot, the main being the usage of Graphics2D for rendering instead of a (at least) OpenGL based solution.

## Pros
Easy to use (or would be if I managed to write documentation!) and simple tools which are quite good at its scale to write simple games or funny graphical applications.

## Bundled Game
In order to test my so called engine, I wrote a game, going by the name of "Higher Grounds" which consists of a character catching sushis and climbing up ever-growing mountains
